//
// ZeeMouse - written by Larry Bank
//
// The name is a reference to the original version from several years ago
// which I wrote to communicate with the ZeeMote bluetooth game controller.
// The device used a proprietary protocol on top of RFCOMM
// instead of implementing HID as a "normal" joystick would. I soon added
// support for several other "undocumented" bluetooth game controllers which
// did the same thing. A while later, Power-A released their MOGA controller.
// They tried to be sneaky by creating a protocol which required special bytes
// to be transmitted to the device before it would send any information. The
// normal protocols for bluetooth game controllers is to constantly send info
// when a button or stick position changes. Power-A tried to tightly control
// what software was authorized to talk to their game controllers. It obviously
// didn't work as well as they had planned because their follow-on products
// added support for the standard HID protocol.
//
// GTK version started 11/26/2015
